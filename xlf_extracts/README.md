# XLF Extracts Folder

This folder contains extracted content from XLF files processed by the `extract_xlf.py` script.

## File Format

**Format:** Tab-separated text (UTF-8 encoded)

**Extension:** `.txt`

**Naming Convention:** `<input_filename>_<content_type>.txt` (default)

## Source

Files in this folder are generated by the `extract_xlf.py` script when extracting content from XLF files in `crowdin-downloads/`.

## Purpose

These extracted files contain specific content types from Semantic Domain translations in a simplified, tab-separated format that is easier to:

- Review and analyze translation progress
- Import into spreadsheets or databases
- Process with other tools or scripts
- Compare translations across languages

## File Contents

Each extraction file contains tab-separated columns with different content depending on the extraction type:

### Names Extraction (`*_names.txt`)

Columns: Domain Abbreviation | Source Name | Target Name

### Names with Descriptions (`*_names_descriptions.txt`)

Columns: Domain Abbreviation | Source Name | Target Name | Source Description

### Descriptions Extraction (`*_descriptions.txt`)

Columns: Domain Abbreviation | Source Description | Target Description

### Descriptions with Names (`*_descriptions_names.txt`)

Columns: Domain Abbreviation | Source Name | Source Description | Target Description

### Questions Extraction (`*_questions.txt`)

Columns: Domain Abbreviation | Source Question | Target Question

## Usage

Files are automatically created when running:

```bash
python extract_xlf.py -n crowdin-downloads/SemanticDomains.pt-BR.xlf
```

Output will be saved to `xlf_extracts/SemanticDomains.pt-BR_names.txt` by default.

You can specify a custom output location:

```bash
python extract_xlf.py -n crowdin-downloads/SemanticDomains.pt-BR.xlf custom_output.txt
```

See the main [README](../README.md) for more details on extraction options.

### Regex tricks

You can use the following VSCode regex searches in a `*_names*` file:

- `^[^\t]+\t[^\t]+\t[^A-Z]` (Match Case on) - translations that don't start with a capital
- `^[^\t]+\t[^\t]+\t[^\n]+[^A-Z]` (Match Case on) - translations that have a non-initial capital letter
- `^[^\t]+\t[^\t]*\b(\w+)\b[^\t]*\t[^\t]*\b\1\b` (Match Case off) - words that appear in both the second and third column
