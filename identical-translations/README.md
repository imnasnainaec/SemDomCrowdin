# Identical Translations Folder

This folder contains output files from translation analysis scripts.

## File Format

**Format:** Plain text (UTF-8 encoded)

**Extension:** `.txt`

**Naming Convention:** `<input_filename>_analysis.txt` (default)

## Source

Files in this folder are generated by the `find_identical_translations.py` script when analyzing XLIFF files from `crowdin-exports/`.

## Purpose

These analysis files identify potential translation issues where:

- Translated content is identical to the source text
- Approved translations contain source text pieces in comma-separated targets
- Non-approved translations match the source exactly

This helps with:

- Quality assurance and translation review
- Identifying untranslated or improperly translated content
- Prioritizing content that needs translator attention

## File Contents

Each analysis file contains:

- Total count of problematic trans-units found
- Results organized by case type:
  - **Case 1: Approved (comma-split)** - Approved translations where comma-separated target pieces match source text
  - **Case 2: Approved + translate=no (identical)** - Approved translations marked as non-translatable that are identical to source
  - **Case 3: Not approved (identical)** - Unapproved translations identical to source text
- For each trans-unit:
  - ID and resource name
  - Source text
  - Target text
  - Matching pieces identified

## Usage

Files are automatically created when running:

```bash
python find_identical_translations.py crowdin-exports/SemanticDomains_pt-BR.xliff
```

Output will be saved to `identical-translations/SemanticDomains_pt-BR_analysis.txt` by default.

See the main [README](../README.md) for more details.
