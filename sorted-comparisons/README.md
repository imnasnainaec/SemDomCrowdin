# Sorted Comparisons Folder

This folder contains sorted and categorized comparison results from interactive grouping sessions.

## File Format

**Format:** Tab-separated values (TSV, UTF-8 encoded)

**Extension:** `.tsv`

**Naming Convention:** `<input_filename>_sorted.tsv` (default)

## Source

Files in this folder are generated by the `sort_comparisons.py` script when interactively sorting comparison files from `xlf-comparisons/`.

## Purpose

These sorted files organize translation changes into user-defined categories for:

- Better understanding of change patterns (e.g., "spelling fixes", "new translations", "improvements")
- Prioritizing review and action items
- Generating reports grouped by change type
- Documenting the nature of translation updates

## File Contents

Each sorted comparison file contains:

- All original columns from the input comparison file
- An additional "Group" column at the end showing the user-assigned category
- Rows organized by group in the file

The column structure matches the input file (from `xlf-comparisons/`) with the group column appended.

## Interactive Sorting Process

Files are created through an interactive process where:

1. Each row is displayed with all its data
2. The user selects which group to assign it to
3. New groups can be created on-the-fly as needed
4. The final output contains all rows with their assigned groups

## Usage

Files are automatically created when running:

```bash
python sort_comparisons.py xlf-comparisons/file_names.tsv 3 4
```

Output will be saved to `sorted-comparisons/<input_filename>_sorted.tsv` by default.

You can specify a custom output location:

```bash
python sort_comparisons.py xlf-comparisons/file.tsv 3 4 custom_path.tsv
```

See the main [README](../README.md) for more details.
