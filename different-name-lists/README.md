# different-name-lists/

This folder contains TSV files with semantic domain names where the comma-separated source and target have different lengths.

## Source

Files are generated by `comma_lists.py` script from XLIFF files in `crowdin-exports/`.

## Purpose

Identifies potential translation issues where comma-separated name lists have different numbers of items in source vs target. This may indicate:

- Missing translations in the list
- Extra translations that shouldn't be there
- Incorrect comma usage or formatting

## Format

Tab-separated values (TSV) files with the following columns:

1. **Abbr Source** - The abbreviation from the corresponding \_Abbr trans-unit (source text)
2. **Name Source** - The semantic domain name in source language (English)
3. **Name Target** - The semantic domain name in target language (translation)
4. **Target State** - The state attribute of the target element (e.g., "translated", "final", "needs-translation")

## Example

```
Abbr Source	Name Source	Name Target	Target State
1.2.3	Animals, Birds	Animais, Pássaros, Insetos	translated
2.1	Person	Pessoa	final
```

In the first example, the source has 2 items (Animals, Birds) but the target has 3 items (Animais, Pássaros, Insetos), indicating a potential issue.

## Usage

These files help reviewers identify and correct list mismatches in semantic domain name translations.
